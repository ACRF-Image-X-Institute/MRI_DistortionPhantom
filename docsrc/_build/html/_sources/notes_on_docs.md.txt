# notes on docs

These notes are mainly for me to remember how to update the docs :-P

requirements: sphinx recommonmark sphinx_rtd_theme sphinx_markdown_tables


From docsrc, ```make html``` produces a copy of the docs at docs/html.
```make github``` produces a copy at docs/github, which is the version hosted by github.
